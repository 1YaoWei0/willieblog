### How to get the Language Id

```c#
string languageText = string.Empty;

if (request.RequestContext.LanguageId != null && request.RequestContext.LanguageId != "") // Get the LanguageId from request context
{
    languageText = request.RequestContext.LanguageId;
}
else
{
    languageText = "en-us";
}

CultureInfo culture = new CultureInfo(languageText); // Get the culture based on LanguageId
```

### Format the amount based on culture

The `decimal.ToString()` included two parameters, for example:

```c#
dl.EffectiveAmount.ToString("C2", culture); // The first parameter means the currency code should be something, the second parameter means the amount value should be format based on some culture rules.â€‹
```
